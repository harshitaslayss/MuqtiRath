MuktiRath — Empowering Women Through Digital Access

**MuktiRath** is a social impact project built by our team, Unchained during MAIT-CSI Innowave 2025. It aims to connect women stuck in prostitution with NGOs that can support their rehabilitation, skill training, and employment. The platform ensures safety, dignity, and accessibility.
